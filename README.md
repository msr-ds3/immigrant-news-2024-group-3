# Replication of "Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric and ICE Reporting Interest: Evidence from a Large-Scale Study of Web Search Data"
This project replicates and extends [this paper](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ac4569925bf02b3f05a651f/t/638b509cb141756009541e29/1670074524751/Immigration_Paper_V2-1.pdf). It focuses on the relationship between media coverage and google searches regarding the topic of immigration, specifically google searches about reporting immigrants to ICE.
The original paper uses Google Trends and Bing search data, combined with automated content analysis of cable news transcripts.

We replicated tables 3-4 and figures 2-4 using Google Trends data and a topic model that was given to us.
